    "       # ... more repositories ...\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This is a list of URLs pointing to different Git repositories. Each URL is a string representing the location of a repository on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Print Statement**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"\\nCloning custom node repositories...\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line prints a message to the console indicating that the script is about to start cloning the repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **For Loop**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for repo in custom_nodes_repos:\n",
    "       repo_name = repo.split('/')[-1].replace('.git', '')\n",
    "       command = f'git clone {repo} /workspace/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/{repo_name}'\n",
    "       run_command(command)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This loop iterates over each URL in the `custom_nodes_repos` list and performs the following steps for each URL:\n",

    "   - **Extract Repository Name**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     repo_name = repo.split('/')[-1].replace('.git', '')\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This line extracts the repository name from the URL. Here's how it works:\n",
    "     - `repo.split('/')` splits the URL into parts using '/' as the delimiter. For example, `\"https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack.git\"` becomes `[\"https:\", \"\", \"github.com\", \"ltdrdata\", \"ComfyUI-Impact-Pack.git\"]`.\n",
    "     - `[-1]` selects the last part of the split URL, which is `\"ComfyUI-Impact-Pack.git\"`.\n",
    "     - `.replace('.git', '')` removes the `.git` extension, resulting in `\"ComfyUI-Impact-Pack\"`.\n",

    "     ```python\n",
    "     command = f'git clone {repo} /workspace/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/{repo_name}'\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This line creates a shell command to clone the repository into a specific directory. The `f'...'` syntax is used for string formatting, inserting the values of `repo` and `repo_name` into the command string.\n",

    "     run_command(command)\n",
